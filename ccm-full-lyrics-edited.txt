And I feel You coming and I hear Your voice on the wind

Would You come and tear down the boxes that I have tried to put You in?
Let love come teach me who You are again
Would you take me back to the place where my heart was only about You
And all I wanted was just to be with You?
Come and do whatever You want to

All nature and science, follow the sound of Your voice

And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky, a canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You, so will I

If the stars were made to worship, so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence, so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high, so will I
If the wind goes where You send it, so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I

The moon and stars they wept
The morning sun was dead
The Savior of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse upon him
One final breath He gave
As Heaven looked away
The Son of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged
The power of hell forever broken

The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love could not be overcome
Now death where is your sting
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated

Forever, He is glorified
Forever, He is lifted high

But if we dance long enough, all the prisons will open up, hey!

[Instrumental]4EmbedTo the mighty cross of Jesus Christ
The earth would shake, beneath the weight
Of darkened skies

On His brow, a crown of sorrow
For a King whose weakness was our strength
No word He spoke, His love was shown
For all to see
O the cross of Jesus Christ
Is the reason I'm alive
For His blood, has set me free
It will never lose, its power for me!

Now the dawn, of resurrection
Floods the night, as hope prevails to shine
Salvation wakes, our chains to break
And we arise!

O the cross of Jesus Christ
Is the reason I'm alive
For His blood, has set me free
It will never lose, its power for me!..

Grace, bought me back again

Won, by the Saviour's love

Hebrews 12 says: "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, 
let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, 
and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. 
Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, 
who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, 
and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 
Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart."
Jesus, we give You our praise, 
You're our greatest prize, 
our greatest treasure and we will forsake everything to the joy of knowing You.

When You walked across the room
And asked me to dance with You
You said, "You're the one I choose"
I couldn't believe it
Like You weren't just passing by
No, You looked me in my eyes
And I found my paradise
[Pre-Chorus: Joe L Barnes]
Oh, You are my paradise
I'm not leaving

[Chorus: Joe L Barnes]
Even if the sun drops out of the sky
Even if the stars stop shining at night
Even if the drummer stops keeping the time
If Your hands are in mine, I won't stop dancing
Dancing on the mountain of a victory
Dancing through the valley of a broken dream
Dancing on the plains of the in-between
If it's You and me, I won't stop dancing

[Post-Chorus: Joe L Barnes]
Mm, I won't stop dancing

Right now, wherever you are
If God is drawing you to himself
And you felt as we were singing
"You are making all things new"
That this moment is meant to be the beginning
Of your new life in Christ
2nd Corinthians 5: 17 says
"That if anyone is in Crist, is a new creation
The old is gone and the new has come
Right now, whether you're in this place tonight
Driving down the road, watching this
On television, online or by DVD
I want to give you the opportunity to say
"This moment, is the moment
Where Jesus Christ made all things new in my life"
And for the person that is tired
Of the same old attempts to clean up your life
The same old dead paths to find joy
Your past has haunted you
Your future has imparalized
No matter how you try
You can't get it together
And the beauty of the Gospel is this:
That Jesus came so that You
Would not have to get it together
But so that you could offer him
The broken pieces of your fragmented life
Your uncertain future
And so that all things could be made new
Churchl let's pray together and for all of you
Who want to receive Jesus Christ
As the Lord and Saviour of your life
You pray this in your heart with me
And God will make all things new
This will be th beginning
Of the best days of your life
And the beginning of an eternal relationship
With the God who sent His Son
To make all things new
Let's pray together church and say this:
Heavenly Father, I need a new start
I need your grace, I need your mercy
I give my life and all of my sins
I turn from my own ways... To trust in you
Thank you Jesus, for dying for me
I believe you rose again, to give new life
I place my hope in you
Make me a brand new person
Give me a brand new start
And I will live for you
All the days of my life
Grace
Mercy
Salvation
Forgiveness
Hope
Restoration
This is a brand new day
You're a brand new person
You have a brand new home, in Jesus nameYou might also likeEmbedWe've got a love the world is desperate for

And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
Of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden
Where another died for me
[Tag 1]
There is another in the fire

All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I’m no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way I won’t bow
To the things of this world
And I know I will never be alone

There is another in the fire
Standing next to me
There is another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
What power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body
And now that power lives in me

[Tag 2]
There is another in the fire

There is no other name
But the Name that is Jesus
He who was and still is
And will be through it all
So come what may in the space between
All the things unseen and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

There'll be another in the fire

O how far I'd scale the valleys
If You graced the other side

O how long have I chased rivers
From lowly seas to where they rise
Against the rush of grace descending
From the source of its supply
In the highlands and the heartache
You’re neither more or less inclined
I would search and stop at nothing
You're just not that hard to find

So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way
You’re the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You're the heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same

O how far beneath Your glory
Does Your kindness extend the path
From where Your feet rest on the sunrise
To where You sweep the sinner's past

O how fast would You come running
If just to shadow me through the night
Trace my steps through all my failure
And walk me out the other side

Before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark
And fleshed out the wonder of light

And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath, the planets form
If the stars were made to worship so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star a signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises so will I
God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain
No syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science
Follow the sound of Your voice

And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky a canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You so will I
So will I

If the stars were made to worship so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I

Every precious one a child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them so will I

And I've been reckless at every bend

There is a Comforter who comforts me

There the blood sets me free

Our wayward notes

Imagine heaven where we stand
Not just some distant promised land
More than some hopeful dying dream
Watch it wind up just as He said
And when it does we'll sing
Like we wished we'd known
We should back then

[Hook] [10x]EmbedOn the earth You rest Your feet
Yet the hands that cradle the stars
Are the hands that bled for me

In a moment of glorious surrender
You were broken for all the world to see
Lifted out of the ashes
I am found in the aftermath
Freedom found in Your scars
In Your grace my life redeemed
For You chose to take the sinner's crown
As You placed Your crown on me

And in that moment of glorious surrender
Was the moment You broke the chains in me
Lifted out of the ashes
I am found in the aftermath

And in that moment You opened up the heavens
To the broken, the beggar and the thief
Lifted out of the wreckage
I found hope in the aftermath

And I know that You're with me
Yes, I know that You're with me here
And I know Your love will light the way

I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

Lead me to the Rock
'Cause I need something higher
Higher than the world could understand
Foolish as the Cross
Humble as the price You paid
The wisdom of a Kingdom made to last
'Cause I don't wanna build this life
On Babylons of bricks and pride
Sitting on a fault line bound to quake
I'd rather be a bedrock fool
Who trusts in nothing less than You
When every other sure thing surely fails

Lead me to the Rock
Lift me from this sinking sand
I'm sorry for the junk I took for grace
Don't let it take a fall
To bring me to my knees again
But if it's what I need
I'll take my place

'Cause I don't wanna build this house
With rubble from the same old ground
Sitting on a fault line bound to quake
I'm banking on a Roman frame
The bedrock of an empty grave
When every other sure thing surely fails

Lord, through it all
Through the wind and the storm
On this Rock I'll stand
Empires may fold
Pillars fail, people fall
But Your Word still stands
Age after age
Till the earth fades away
Still Your Kingdom stands
Name above names
Jesus, I need Your grace
'Cause the world's gone mad

In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
If the stars were made to worship, so will I

All nature and science, follow the sound of Your voice

And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If creation still obeys You, so will I

And if the stars were made to worship, so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence, so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high, so will I
And if the wind goes where You send it, so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I

You prayed through the night
Unbearable sorrow
The world on Your mind

Betrayed by the kiss of a friend, You were taken
By Your own free will
Rejected and disowned by those You came to heal
Stripped of Your clothes, You were mocked, You were beaten
Made a King of fools
A crown of sorrow driven deep into Your brow
Yet You made no sound
What You went through to love me
I'll never understand
What blows my mind away is
You love me as I am

Thеy called for Barabbas
A King for a thief
Parading Your kindness
Likе rags through the streets

Draped with the weight of the world on Your shoulders
As You climbed that hill
A burden far too great for flesh and bone to bear
You stretched out Your arms as You welcomed those Roman nails
Your body frail
The very hands that shaped the world hung up to bleed
Lifted on high, crucified Him who knew no sin
The Nazarene
The Son of Man, the Lamb of God, Emmanuel
Given to die

To take up my cross and follow You Lord

When You speak the fiercest of oceans is still
And I see the sinner seek devotion
The lost become chosen and I fall to my knees
I'm forgiven by a Savior who did not deserve death
He was blameless I was lost in shamefulness
I'm delivered but it doesn't seem right
Unless I keep my eyes focused on the Savior
Who gave His life
In the middle of a world that denies it believes
It is breaking apart at the very seams
There is one thing to be alive for
To take up this cross and follow You Lord

Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay, You set me on a rock
You called me by Your name
And made my heart whole again

Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
That I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
(So come on then)
You pulled me from the clay, You set me on a rock
You called me by Your name
And made my heart whole again
So here I stand, high in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart, now and forever
My soul cries out
Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way

Here I stand (Come on), high in surrender
I need You now (He's the present God, He's here)

But the crazy thing is when you hold on to it, nothing happens
And you just become burdened
But when you release it to God, who is the Restorer, who is the Redeemer, who is the Reconciler
That's when His grace works
And He brings beauty out of ashes and He does the thing that only He can do
And He works in mysterious ways
And I don't know if it's going to happen in a moment tonight that it breaks
But I'm believing that it can
That a moment in the presence of God, it can happen tonight
So if that's you tonight and there's things you need to release to God
There's things you need to say, you know what, I can't do this oh God
But not my will but Your will be done, in this part of my life
If that's you, would you lift your hand tonight?
It could be big, it could be small
But the cool thing is, this isn't about me, but this is between you and Jesus
And I believe that there's gonna be freedom in this place
'Cause it is for freedom that He set us free
Come on, you sing this out

Here I stand, high in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart, now and forever
My soul cries out
Here I stand, high in surrender
I need You now (Oh, I stand here)
Hold my heart, now and forever
My soul cries out (Where we stand now)
Here I stand, high in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart, now and forever
My soul cries out
'Cause once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now (Thank You, Lord)
I'm healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I

The Light of the world abandoned in darkness to die

If You gladly chose surrender, so will I

Like You would again a hundred billion times
But what measure could amount to Your desire?
You're the One who never leaves the one behindEmbedWhen You died for the sins of men
And You let out a cry
Crucified, now alive in me

These hands are Yours, teach them to serve as You please
And I'll reach out, desperate to see
All the greatness of God
Now my soul rest assured in You

In victorious sight of You

And oh, how far I'd scale the valleys
If You graced the other side
Oh, how long have I chased rivers
From lowly seas to where they rise
Against the rush of grace descending
From the source of its supply

'Cause in the highlands and the heartache
You're neither more or less inclined
I would search and stop at nothing
You're just not that hard to find (Hey)
So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You're the heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same

And oh, how far beneath Your glory
Does Your kindness extend the path
From where Your feet rest on the sunrise
To where You sweep the sinner's past
And oh, how fast would You come running
If just to shadow me through the night
Trace my steps through all my failure
And walk me out the other side

For who could dare ascend that mountain
That valleyed hill called Calvary

From a deep but empty graveEmbedI've been faithful and I've been reckless at every bend
I've held everything together and watched it shatter
I've stood tall and I have crumbled in the same breath

I have wrestled and I have trembled toward surrender
Chased my heart adrift and drifted home again
Plundered blessing 'til I've been despеrate to find redemption
And еvery time I turn around, Lord, You're still there
I was found (Come on sing) before I was lost
I was Yours before I was not
Grace to spare for all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me

And I know I, I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow this kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow You love me as You find me (Come on)

Who am I to think Your glory needs my praises?
But if this borrowed breath is Yours, Lord, take it all (Come on)
You are faithful and You are gracious and I'm just grateful
To think You don't need a single thing and still You want my heart (Oh, oh)

I was found before I was lost
I was Yours before I was not
You wear the scars for all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me

This song was written in New York City for New York City
For anyone who's in the middle of the fight of your life
For anyone who's in the middle of a storm
For anybody who's in the season where you can't see a way out
For anyone who's in the season where you might feel alone, I wanna promise you
There is one who never leaves or forsakes us
He is with you in every moment, there is hope for you
And this song is our declaration of faith
That the God who was faithful back then
Is faithful now and will be faithful to the end, in Jesus' name, amen
Come on, Chris
There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
Of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden
Where another died for me
There is another in the fire

Sing all my debt
All my debt left for dead beneath the waters (Hey)
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way I won't bow to the things of this world
And I know I will never be alone
You might also likeThere is another in the fire

There is another in the fire, woah-oh
There is another in the fire, woah-oh
There is another in the fire, woah-oh (I can see)

And I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin
I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between us

Come on, you sing
There is no other name but the Name that is Jesus
And He who was and still is and will be through it all
So come what may in the space between
All the things unseen and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone, oh
And I know I will never be alone
There'll be another in the fire
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
How good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be

And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

There was another in the fire, standing next to me
There was another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding, what powеr set free
There is a cross that bеars the burden, where another died for me
There is another in the fire
All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way I won't bow to the things of this world
And I know
And I know I will never be alone

There is another in the fire, standing next to me
There is another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding, what power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body, and now that power lives in me

I can see the light in the darkness as the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens as the space between wears thin
I can feel the ground shake beneath us as the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us, nothing stands between us

There is no other name but the name that is Jesus
He who was and still is, and will be through it all
So come what may in the space between
All the things unseen and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

I have to keep slapping myself in the face 'cause, like, is this real life? You know what I mean
But we're just so grateful that everyone would be here
Maybe you're here, someone duped you into coming
You were expecting Billy Joel or something and
Here's the thing, I don't believe that anybody's here by accidеnt
The saying says, "You don't have to beliеve to belong, you're welcome in this place just the way you are"
This has gotta be the most storied room in the greatest city on earth
But tonight, tonight it's ours
And we got nothing tonight without the presence of God
Because God, for all His mystery, is able to stir this place up
Until it folds inside-out and I believe that might happen tonight
And so, one time, before we get started, regardless of where you're sitting
Regardless of where you've come from
Can we just, one time, make as much noise as we can to get this thing started right?
To the Man above every single hand tonight
One, two, three, come on
See, I don't know about you, but I just think it sounds better when we're all in it together
You know what I'm saying?
That's what tonight's about, come onYou might also likeEmbedLord God Almighty

[Instrumental]EmbedBy His own betrayed
The sin of men and wrath of God
Has been on Jesus laid

Silent as He stood accused
Beaten, mocked, and scorned
Bowing to the Father's will
He took a crown of thorns
And oh that rugged cross, my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"
Praise and honour unto Thee

Sent of heaven, God's own Son
To purchase and redeem
And reconcile the very ones
Who nailed Him to that tree

Oh that rugged cross, my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"
Praise and honour unto Thee

Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full
By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled
Now the curse of sin has no hold on me
Whom the Son sets free, oh is free indeed!
Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full

When I least deserved a chance
For I'm a thief upon a tree
And You say Glory waits for me

Where You wept in blood and tears

Should ever he appear
For the serpent tried to end Your life
But he only bruised Your heel
See the empty grave is overgrown
And the earth begins to heal
For the enemy is overthrown
And the darkness finally yields

It is the night
Of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
Till He appeared
And the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born

Truly He taught us
To love one another
His law is love
And His gospel is peace
Chains He shall break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy
In grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us
Praise His holy name

Christ is the Lord
O praise His name forever
His power and glory
Evermore proclaim

To a cradle in the dirt

Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one

And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation

You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake You died

Praise the Father, praise the Son

All of heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored
And the church of Christ was born

Shall not kneel, shall not faint

Don't know why it felt familiar
But I knew it right away
There were times it seemed so simple
And sometimes so unsure
But not a moment was ever wasted
Knelt behind those closed doors

’Cause the secret place is secret
That's where it gets its name
It's not hiding, but it’s hidden
Far from all religious games
No, it won't bring recognition
Or get called upon a stage
'Cause the melody is sacred
You sing in the secret place
It's an open invitation
No words you have to say
If you want it you can get there
There's a thousand different ways
There's no glory in the method
None are right and none are wrong
You just put your trust in Jesus
And then start to sing along

'Cause just as you are, you're welcome
There’s no part you have to play
Doesn’t need to be impressive
Couldn't do that anyway
’Cause when it gets too complicated
That melody will fade
But if you take the time to listen
You can hear Heaven's refrain

There'll be days that it feels distant
So far beyond my reach
Like my failures locked the entrance
And my spirit lost the keys
But the beauty of the secret
That I'm so grateful for
Is that Your presence doesn’t need me
To kick down an open door

For He grew up before Him like a young plant
And a root out of dry ground
He had no form or majesty that we should look at Him
And no beauty that we should desire Him
He was despised and rejected by men
A Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief
And as one from whom men hide their faces
He was despised and we esteemed Him not
Surеly He has borne our griefs
And carriеd our sorrows
Yet we esteemed him stricken
Smitten by God and afflicted
But He was pierced for our transgressions
He was crushed for our iniquities
Upon Him was the chastisement that brought us peace
And with His wounds, we are healed
All we like sheep have gone astray
We have turned every one to His own way
And the Lord has laid on Him

And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
For even in your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus, for our sake, you died

Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

And the morning that You rose
All of Heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored
And the church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel, shall not faint
By His blood and in His name
In His freedom, I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me, oh-oh

Don’t know why it felt familiar
But I knew it right away
There were times it seemed so simple
And sometimes so unsure
But not a moment was ever wasted
Knelt behind those closed doors

VERSE 2:
‘Cause the secret place is secret
That’s where it gets its name
It’s not hiding but it’s hidden
Far from all religious games
No it won’t bring recognition
Or get called up on a stage
‘Cause the melody is sacred
You sing in the secret place
VERSE 3:
It’s an open invitation

There’s no glory in the method
None are right and none are wrong
You just put your trust in Jesus
And then start to sing along

VERSE 4:
‘Cause just as you are you’re welcome

But if you take the time to listen
You can hear heaven’s refrain

VERSE 5:
There’ll be days that it feels distant

Rescue every daughter, bring us back the wayward sons
And by Your spirit breathe upon them
Show the world that You alone can save

A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we could build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No man"
"But you can do the job when you're in town"

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrillin'?
Though your nose gets a chillin'
We'll frolic and play

Sorting out a million thoughts running through your head
To everyone that's waiting
For better days ahead
Tired, and frustrated, and leaving words unsaid
Please don't hold your breath

Release your heavy burdens and let everything that has breath praise the Lord

For it's not by might or by power
But by Your Spirit
Put Your Spirit on this thing, Father
Put Your Spirit on this thing
Let Your pleasure be known and felt, hallelujah
Let Your pleasure be known and felt on these songs tonight

If we turn from our wicked ways
Humbled ourselves and prayed
And seek Your face, You'd give us grace

When I look around, all I see is the blood (Oh) (Oh)
Even if I look back to three to four years ago
When I was stuck in the pit
Had nowhere else to turn
Nowhere else to look
I couldn't see it back then
As I look back I see the blood
I thought it had left me
But as I look back, I see the blood
I thought it forsook me
But as I look back, I see the blood (There on the Cross)
I thought I was unredeemable
But as I look back, I see the blood
You're showing me the blood
It was there all along, I see the blood (It was there all along)

Behold throughout the heavens

When, lo! Above the Earth
Rang out the angel chorus
That hailed our Savior's birth

Our humble Christ was born
And brought us all salvation

Um, I didn't know what to expect walking in here by myself
I’m normally with three other hooligans
I'm so honored and grateful to be where I'm supposed to be
Where thе Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom, thеre is liberty
And that’s why He brought me here
And I've been asking Him:
"What is it that You want me to do?"
And it's worship
It's what I do sitting at home
It's what I do walking in the street
It's what I do everywhere
And to be around people who know God the way I've known Him
To be my only friend
He saved my life
I can't sing the words
Without feeling the truth that they hold
He’s been my hiding place
I’m an introvert
I wanna run and hide
And He was that safety
He told me it was okay
And He told me, "I love you, you're precious to Me"
The first person to ever tell me that "I love you"
It didn’t come from my family
Didn't come from my parents
It came from God

Days, they get dark, I can't forget, I'm a light strobe
I let 'em side talk, my sidewalk like Michael
Everything I touch has got a bright glow, the Bible
Gave me a word instrumental, like a maestro
To my survival, been growin' without these bridles
They carry (On and on), like Badu was on it (On and on)

What Juneteenth is, and— on June nineteenth
Alright, in— in— in 1865, everybody was supposed to be free, but there was, uh
Some people who didn't know they were free
In Texas, the people of Texas
They— They— They didn't know slavery was over
So if everybody's not free, then nobody's free, amen?
And so on July fourth
There were certain people who could not celebrate independence
Their independence came on June nineteenth
And so we can sit here and say
"Man, we love the freedom that we get to experience as believers"
But there's certain people out there that— that don't have the freedom that we get to experience
And we want them to experience that as well
Well, in 1865, everybody needed to experience the freedom
That they should have gotten and they didn't get that
And so in this day and age, we wanna celebrate everyone's freedom
We wanna celebrate the reality that God created us equal
That we are all humanity
That we are all God's children
And we all deserve to enjoy, to taste and see that God is good
Nobody should have that deprived of them
And so that's why we're here today
We're here to celebrate the reality that, man, God's people were set free
They were set free
Goodness and mercy pursued them and they were set free
They were liberated and that's something that we celebrate
If we can celebrate July fourth, we got to celebrate Juneteenth
And so, y'all, it— it's so much bigger than that
Because we're not just celebrating days
We're celebrating that image-bearers
People made in the image of God
Could now now taste and see how good God is
Could now dance in the streets together, hold hands
And it— it wasn't complete freedom
It— It obviously takes a minute
But we're still here today to work toward that reality
We're here today to celebrate what our ancestors couldn't celebrate, right?
And we're here today to celebrate a— a bigger reality
That even though some of us have been removed from slavery in an instant
That sometimes it takes a lifetime to get the slavery out of us
Sometimes that mentality still has to be removed from us
And— And— And there are people here today
Black and brown faces, who need to believe that they are free
That they— That they have the same rights, the same liberty that God has given everybody
And you know how they experience that?
By— By love being demonstrated, by empathy being demonstrated
By graciousness being demonstrated, by everyone being treated as God's image-bearersYou might also likeEmbedI got nothing new
