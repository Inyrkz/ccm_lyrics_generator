# ccm_lyrics_generator
AI model to generate lyrics for the contemporary christian music genre

This project involves training a deep learning algorithm to generate lyrics of the Christian Contemporary Music genre based on the seed text of the user. This project brings my skills in data engineering and machine learning together. I use Extract, Transform & Load (ETL) to get lyrics of various CCM artists and store them in a text file. I'm training a deep learning model using the LSTM algorithm in TensorFlow to generate lyrics. 

This is fun!
