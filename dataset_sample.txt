Your Unfailing Love

when the darkness fills my senses
when my blindness keeps me from your touch,
Jesus come

When my burden keeps me doubting
when my memories take the place of you
Jesus come

And I'll follow you there
to the place where we meet
and I'll lay down my pride
as you search me again

Your unfailing love, your unfailing love,
your unfailing love over me again

I'll walk closer now on the higher way
Through the darkest night will you hold my hand
Jesus guide my way

O you mourn with me and you dance with me
For my heart of hearts is bound to you

Though I walk through valleys low
I'll fear no evil
By the waters still my soul
My heart will trust in You
O You counsel me and You comfort me
When I cannot see
You light my path
My heart will trust in you

What to say, Lord? It's
You who gave me life and I
Can't explain just how
Much You mean to me now
That You have saved me, Lord
I give all that I am to You
That everyday I could
Be a light that shines Your name

Everyday, Lord, I'll
Learn to stand upon Your word
And I pray that I
I might come to know You more
That You would guide me in every single step I take, that
Everyday I can
Be Your light unto the world

Everyday, it's You I live for
Everyday, I'll follow after You
Everyday, I'll walk with You, my Lord

Everyday, Lord, I'll
Learn to stand upon Your word
And I pray that I
I might come to know You more
That You would guide me in every single step I take, that
Everyday I can
Be Your light unto the world

Everyday, it's You I live for
Everyday, I'll follow after You
Everyday, I'll walk with You, my Lord

It's You I live for, everyday
It's You I live for, everyday
It's You I live for, everyday
It's You I live for, everyday

Everyday, it's You I live for
Everyday, I'll follow after You
Everyday, I'll walk with You, my Lord

Everyday, it's You I live for
Everyday, I'll follow after You
Everyday, I'll walk with You, my Lord

Mountains will be moved
As our praise rises up to you

I will pray, I will pray

Let your kingdom come
Pray your will be done
Nations will see your fame
On the lord's day

I will pray, I will pray

Reach out my hands
before you
My Keeper, I will come running
Into your arms,
Its you I long for
With all my heart

I want to know you
You are all I want
I want to know you
More

I need Your Love
Like the desert needs the rain
I need Your touch
Like the fire needs the flame
One moment without You near
Is heartache I cannot bear
A lifetime with You O Lord
Is Heaven I long to Know
Heaven
Come over me
Like the oceans meets the shore
Shine on my life
Like the morning
Steals the night
one moment without you near
is heartache i cannot bear
a lifetime with you oh Lord
Heaven i long to know

It's You I can't escape
Your love has me surrounded
In every way
So I surrender now
And raise my hands
All I want is You (All I want is You)

You have carried me
Through many storms
And many raging seas
You rescue me
In my hour of need
And all I want is You (All I want is You)

I'm coming to You
For the love that I need
I'm desperate for Your touch
I'm seeking You
I'm seeking You

You're always by my side
My closest friend
In You I can rely
You're with me
Every moment of my life
All I want is You (All I want is You)

I remember the first time
'Til I see beyond the storm
Surrounding me with Your love
I turn to find You near

You take me higher
You lift my head to open skies
Your fire burns within my soul
Abandoned to Your call

Your love reached deep
Into my world
You read me
Like an open book

You took all the pieces
And made my life complete
In You
I soar on the heights
Of Your love
Dive the depths of Your grace

You take me higher
'Til I see beyond the storm
Surrounding me with Your love
I turn to find You near

You take me higher
You lift my head to open skies
Your fire burns within my soul
Abandoned to Your call

I take the hand of One
Who knows me
From the inside out
He guides me through
The streets of life

He take me through
Open doors
They open onto fields of white
He tells me to see
And perceive
And to hear their cry

You take me higher
'Til I see beyond the storm
Surrounding me with Your love
I turn to find You near

You take me higher
You lift my head to open skies
Your fire burns within my soul
Abandoned to Your call

Hear our prayer
Spirit, come
How I long for
Your sweet touch.

On my knees
I cry out
Jesus, Savior
Behold your child.

Like a deer longing for water
My soul yearns;
Only you can fill my deep hunger
My heart burns
My heart burns.

Oceans deep
Mountains high
O my God, I cannot live without your love
I cannot live without your love.

We seek the Son of God
We seek the Risen Lord
We seek the King of kings
The Savior of the world

We give our lives to You
We choose to follow You
We believe in You
We worship You

We seek Your face and
Humble ourselves here
The fire of God
Consuming the hearts of man

Nations will bow to You
Kingdoms will shake before
You
We pray for revival
We pray for revival

Holy Spirit, Touch Your people
Teach us the ways of God
And as we live, As Jesus did
You are honored and lifted up

There's a stirring in the Spirit
There's an urgency in this hour
We as children must obey
Can you hear
The footsteps of God

God is moving, God is moving

Can you hear the sound
Of revival

As we praise You, as we sing
Draw near to us O God

As we cry out for the nations
Pour out revival in the land

There's a stirring in the Spirit
There's an urgency in this hour
We as children must obey
Can you hear
The footsteps of God

Have you heard of the One called Saviour?
Have you heard of His perfect love?
Have you heard of the One in Heaven?
Have you heard how He gave His Son?
Well I have found this love and I believe in the Son show me your way

Oh Lord You have shown Your favour
Your every word stands true
I'm found safe within in Your harbour
Anchored deep in You
You washed away my tears
Gave me joy and freedom
Lifting me through the years
Your love is stronger than
The sound of heaven's praises
Higher than
The lofty mountain peaks
Deeper than
The deepest ocean valleys
Strong enough for me
I'll Worship at Your Throne
Whisper my own love song
With all my heart I'll sing
For You my Dad and King
I'll live for all my days
To Put a smile on Your face
And when we finally meet
It'll be for eternity

And Oh how wide You open up Your arms
When I need Your love
And how far You would come
If ever I was lost
And You said that all You feel for me
Is undying love
That You showed me through the cross

I'll worship You my God
I'll worship You my God
I love You
I love You
Forever I will sing
Forever I will be with You
Be with You
I'm totally abandoned to You
I'm lost inside the rivers of Your love
I'm swept into the power of Your presence
Drawn toward the whisper of Your voice
I come to You in quiet adoration
And fall before Your feet You are my King
I'm living for the beauty of Your Presence
To behold the glory of Your face
Holy, Worthy, is the Lord
Heaven declares Your Rightousness
Oh God of All Creation
I worship You
Oh when You said seek Your face
My heart said Your face I will seek
Night and day I seek Your face
Long for You in the secret place
All I want in this life
Is to truly know you more...

As the waters cover the sea,
So Your love covers me
Guiding me on,
Roads unknown
I trust in You alone
My Saving Grace
My endless love
Deeper and deeper I'm falling in love with You
My one desire
My only truth
Deeper and deeper I'm falling in love with you
with you
fallin' in love with you
ohhhhh
And I will rise on wings of eagles
Soaring high above all my fears
I rest in Your open arms of love
As the waters cover the sea
So your love covers me
covers me

The day I found You,
You made my world brand new,
and You covered it with love

Changed my direction,
and now I'm heaven bound
I'm running to You

Once lost, but now I'm found in You
Once shipwrecked now I'm grateful these days
I live for You

Like a river, You flood my soul with love
Overflowing into joy
Like a downpour, Your spirit raining down
Let it fall, Let it fall
I'm living for the King
I live for You

For You have set me free
You're all that I seek
Your love completes my life
You're the air that I breathe
And the Saviour of the world He's the reason I'm livin'
I will sing
And I will lift my voice to the one who has saved me
I will sing
I will sing
And I'll cry out for more saying Lord I need you
I will reach out
Im reaching for more of you in my heart
And I will wait on You
In the stillness Lord
Listening for Your voice
Pure as gold refined
In Your presence Lord here where I belong
